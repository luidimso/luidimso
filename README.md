### Hello :)

I am a front-end programmer, working with Angular, but also with experience building APIs with NodeJS. I also work with mobile development with Ionic. Most of my experience is working with Javascript and Typescript, thus they are my main programming languages.

I'm always looking to study new technologies or other things. Now I'm focusing on studying English, as it was a goal that I made last year for this year.
